# Cybersecurity Tabletop Exercises (TTX) — Notes

Source: CISA materials (see PDFs in this folder).

## Overview

A tabletop exercise (TTX) is a role‑playing activity where players respond to scenarios presented by facilitators. Players usually play their real roles (CEO, IT lead, comms), but may fill in for missing roles.

Facilitators may introduce facts that seem innocuous initially, later turning out to be signals of a serious issue. They may also present contradictory information to test how the team prioritizes and validates inputs.

The goal is not perfect performance — it’s to practice coordination and uncover gaps while it’s safe to do so.

## Roles

- **Players/Participants**: Discuss and initiate actions as they would in a real incident.
- **Observers**: Do not directly participate; help by asking questions or providing expertise.
- **Facilitators**: Present updates, moderate discussion, and resolve questions.
- **Note-takers**: Document discussions, decisions, and how well plans/procedures were followed.

## Tips

- Think out loud.
- Support each other and ask clarifying questions.
- Use the exercise to surface gaps (“no one owns that”).
- Keep it inclusive: no spectators.
- Keep it lightweight: short discussions at staff meetings can help.
- Keep shared notes in real time.

## Common Mistakes

- Not having the printed IRP on hand (or not using it).
- Using outdated contact lists.
- Assigning an Incident Manager too late.
- Forgetting to notify stakeholders early enough.
- Notifying law enforcement without legal involvement.

## Example Scenario (Wire Fraud)

Michael, a senior accountant, receives a call from the company’s bank confirming a $50,000 transfer to a vendor’s new offshore account. A second transfer of $150,000 failed due to insufficient funds. Michael did not initiate either transfer and is the only person authorized to transfer funds.
